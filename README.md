How to Run the Expense Tracker Project

1. Running the Backend (Python)
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Save the backend Python script as expense_tracker.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the folder where expense_tracker.py is saved.
Run the script using:
bash
Copy
Edit
python expense_tracker.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to add or view expenses.

3. Running the Frontend (HTML & CSS)
Save the HTML file as index.html and the CSS file as styles.css in the same folder.
Open index.html in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
How to Connect Frontend & Backend?
Since the backend is a simple Python script without Flask or Django, it doesn't have a web API. You have two options:

Manually Enter Data

Use the Python script to enter/view expenses.
The HTML page can be used only for displaying static UI.
Modify Backend to Read & Write JSON
